                Hi, <strong>I'm Xander Rancap</strong> — a dedicated software developer
                currently studying <strong>Software Development</strong> at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology with a 3.7 GPA in the second semester. I bring a combination of technical skills, real-world experience, and strong interpersonal abilities shaped by years of working in customer-focused environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                In February 2024, I interned at Eduspec Holdings Berhad, a robotics-focused company based in Metro Manila. During this internship, I worked hands-on with educational robotics platforms including Arduino, SAM Labs, and VEX Robotics. I collaborated on and led various circuit design and programming tasks—enhancing both my hardware understanding and software logic skills. This experience sharpened my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios while also strengthening my leadership and teamwork capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Between 2023 and 2024, I led two research projects during my senior high school years. One study evaluated the effectiveness of <em>Verdura Glow</em>—a natural soap infused with <em>Gliricidia sepium</em> (Madre de Cacao) and <em>Annona muricata</em> (Guyabano) leaves—on itch relief and burn mark fading. The other explored the correlation between sleep deprivation and the academic performance of Grade 12 students in the Dentistry specialization at Centro Escolar Integrated School–Manila. Although these topics differ from my current program, they sharpened my research, collaboration, and analytical skills—foundational abilities that continue to serve me in software development.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've led multiple group projects that applied object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, where I guided my group in designing scalable, maintainable applications. For my final project in OOP, I led my group in building a cross-platform application using .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid—blending web and native app development to deliver a smooth user experience across devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                My technical toolkit includes languages like C#, Python, JavaScript, and SQL, with a strong grasp of front-end technologies like HTML and CSS. Alongside development, I use Figma to design intuitive, user-centered interfaces—bridging the gap between functionality and user experience. I'm passionate about building clean, efficient software that solves real problems, and I'm always looking to grow and collaborate with others in the tech space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether it's working through a complex coding problem or coordinating a team, I thrive in dynamic, team-oriented environments and bring a strong sense of organization, communication, and creativity to everything I do.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities. I play musical instruments and stay active through workouts, running, and sports, which help me stay energized and focused.
              </p>

          <h3>Gym Web Application</h3>
          <h4>.Net Maui Blazor-Hybrid</h4>
          <p>This project is a cross-platform gym management web application built with .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid in C#. It combines the performance of native applications with the flexibility of web technologies, allowing it to run smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices. The app features a secure login and registration system, a clean landing page with intuitive navigation, and a fully integrated database that manages users, memberships, schedules, and other gym-related data.</p>
            
          <p>In addition to core functionality such as profile management and membership tracking, the design emphasizes responsiveness and usability, ensuring a seamless experience across platforms. This project highlights my skills in full-stack development, database integration, and building hybrid applications that are scalable, modern, and user-friendly.</p>

          <h3>NV Closet</h3>
          <h4>Figma Mock-up</h4>
          <p>NV is a modern closet management application designed to help users organize their wardrobe and generate personalized outfit suggestions. Built with a clean and intuitive interface, the app allows users to digitally store and categorize their clothing items, making it easy to browse and plan outfits. A key feature of NV is its AI integration, which analyzes the user’s stored clothes and automatically generates stylish outfit combinations based on season, occasion, or personal preferences.</p>

          <p>With its focus on both functionality and design, NV shows my skills in UI/UX design. The project shows how technology can simplify everyday routines by combining smart recommendations with a user-friendly experience.</p>
