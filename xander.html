                Hi, I'm Xander Rancap — a dedicated and fast-learning software developer currently studying Software Development at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology with a 3.7 GPA in the second semester. I bring a unique combination of technical skills, real-world experience, and strong interpersonal abilities shaped by years of working in customer-focused environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                In February 2024, I interned at Eduspec Holdings Berhad, a robotics-focused company based in Metro Manila. During this internship, I worked hands-on with educational robotics platforms including Arduino, SAM Labs, and VEX Robotics. I collaborated on and led various circuit design and programming tasks—enhancing both my hardware understanding and software logic skills. This experience sharpened my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios while also strengthening my leadership and teamwork capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Between 2023 and 2024, I led two research projects during my senior high school years. One study evaluated the effectiveness of <em>Verdura Glow</em>—a natural soap infused with <em>Gliricidia sepium</em> (Madre de Cacao) and <em>Annona muricata</em> (Guyabano) leaves—on itch relief and burn mark fading. The other explored the correlation between sleep deprivation and the academic performance of Grade 12 students in the Dentistry specialization at Centro Escolar Integrated School–Manila. Although these topics differ from my current program, they sharpened my research, collaboration, and analytical skills—foundational abilities that continue to serve me in software development.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've led multiple group projects that applied object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, where I guided teams in designing scalable, maintainable applications. For my final project in OOP, I led my group in building a cross-platform application using .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid—blending web and native app development to deliver a smooth user experience across devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                My technical toolkit includes languages like C#, Python, JavaScript, and SQL, with a strong grasp of front-end technologies like HTML and CSS. Alongside development, I use Figma to design intuitive, user-centered interfaces—bridging the gap between functionality and user experience. I'm passionate about building clean, efficient software that solves real problems, and I'm always looking to grow and collaborate with others in the tech space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether it's working through a complex coding problem or coordinating a team, I thrive in dynamic, team-oriented environments and bring a strong sense of organization, communication, and creativity to everything I do.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities. I play musical instruments and stay active through workouts, running, and sports, which help me stay energized and focused. I’m also passionate about volunteering and love finding opportunities to give back to the community.
              </p>
